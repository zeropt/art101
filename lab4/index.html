		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>
			We were challenged with producing two sets of pseudocode lists. The first would be a logical list that anyone can follow to complete a specific task. The other described a process for a computer to perform a specific task.

	<div id="problems">
		<h2>Problems</h2>

			We were figure out with ideas and stuck on problems

	<div id="results">
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>
			For the the first list, we produced a step-by-step process for changing the display name that shows in a Zoom meeting.
			<pre><code>
Setting the Zoom display name:
	Open zoom application or open the zoom site
	Sign in with your zoom account
	If using the app
		Click the settings button (Gear Symbol)
		Click the profile tab
		Click “Edit My Profile”. This will send you to the site
		If not signed in
			Sign in
	If using the site
		Go to Personal via Profile
	On the right-hand side of the page, right of the name field click “Edit”
	Change the text under “Display Name”
	Press save
			</pre></code>
			For the second pseudocode, we modeled an elevator/lift. We turned this into comments in a javascript file.
			<pre><code>
// Description. This file holds the Elevator operation pseudocode
// @author Raymond Wong, Riley Mann

//If ready to target, destination floor = nearest requested floor
//If the destination floor is above:
	//Move upwards
	//Up arrow lights up
//If the destination floor is below
	//Move downwards
	//Down arrow lights up
//If at the destination floor:
	//Wait 3s then open the door for 20s
	//If the sensor is tripped, reset the timer to 20s
	//If the “open door” button is pushed, reset the timer to 20s
	//If the “close door” button is pushed, nothing happens
	//If the timer finishes
    //close the door
    //ready to target again
//If an external floor button is pressed request this floor
//If an inside floor button is pressed request that floor
