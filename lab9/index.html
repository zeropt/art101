	<h1>Lab 9: JavaScript for the Web</h1>
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>
		We need to create a document using createElement and getElementById.
	</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>
		We ended up needing to look up the various attributes and functions and test
		in the console since we didn't know how to implement them at first.
	</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>
		We were able to output two new elements and used getElementsByTagName to
		change to color and font in the webpage.
	</p>
	<div id=output>
		<h3>Output:</h3>
	</div>
