	<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
	<p>
		We have created a function that take your name and regenerated to a different new name.
	</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
	<p>
		We had to troubleshoot a problem where the string wasn't being sorted. We
		found out that we forgot to put the empty single quotes in the string.split
		method and the string was therefore not being split on anything. Adding
		these in solved our problem.
	</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>
		We have a website that sort the name.
